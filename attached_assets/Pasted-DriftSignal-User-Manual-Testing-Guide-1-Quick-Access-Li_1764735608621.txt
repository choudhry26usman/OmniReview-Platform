DriftSignal: User Manual & Testing Guide
1. Quick Access
Live App URL: https://replit.com/join/mwzovmgwyg-reiddm1
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/choudhry26usman/DriftSignal
2. Authentication & Security
The system utilizes Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) for secure, session-based access. * How to Login: 1. Click the "Login with Replit" button. 2. The system will automatically authenticate you using your existing browser session. 3. Note: No username/password is required. User data is isolated by your unique Replit User ID.

3. Core Feature Walkthrough
A. The "Glass-Morphic" Dashboard
Upon logging in, you will see the Unified Command Center. * Visual Style: Notice the translucent "frosted glass" cards and vibrant blue gradient background (inspired by Linear/Notion). * The Feed: This list aggregates live feedback from Amazon, Walmart, and Email. * Filtering: Use the top bar to filter by Platform (Amazon vs. Shopify) or Sentiment (Critical/High/Low).

B. Kanban Workflow Management
DriftSignal uses a drag-and-drop workflow to track issue resolution. 1. Locate a Review: Find a card in the "Open" column. 2. Action: Click and drag the card to the "In Progress" column. 3. Verification: Refresh the page. The card remains in "In Progress," confirming that the state was successfully saved to the Neon PostgreSQL database.

C. AI Intelligence (Powered by Grok 4.1)
We utilize xAI's Grok 4.1 Fast model for superior reasoning speed. 1. AI Assistant: Click the Chat Icon (bottom right corner). 2. Ask a Question: Type "Show me all negative reviews about shipping delays." 3. Result: The AI interprets your natural language, queries the database, and returns a filtered list of relevant reviews.

D. Data Integrations
Navigate to Settings > Integrations to view the status of our API proxies. * Amazon: Connected via Axesso Data Service (RapidAPI). * Walmart: Connected via SerpApi. * Email: Connected via Microsoft Graph (Outlook). (Note: Green indicators confirm the API keys are active).

4. Troubleshooting Guide
Issue: "Database Error" or Infinite Loading
Cause: The Neon Serverless Postgres instance may enter "Sleep Mode" after 5 minutes of inactivity to save costs.
Fix: Refresh the browser page once. Wait 10-15 seconds for the "Cold Start" to complete. The data will appear automatically.
Issue: AI Chat Not Responding
Cause: The OpenRouter API rate limit may be exceeded.
Fix: Wait 30 seconds and try again. The system includes automatic error propagation that will display a toast notification if the API fails.
Issue: Drag-and-Drop Not Saving
Cause: Network latency between the client and the Drizzle ORM.
Fix: Check your internet connection. A red "Sync Failed" badge will appear in the top right corner if the database write fails.
5. System Requirements
Browser: Chrome v90+ or Edge (Required for Glass-morphism CSS blur effects).
Device: Desktop recommended for Kanban management; Mobile View is supported for read-only access.
