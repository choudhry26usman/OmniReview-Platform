DriftSignal: AI-Powered Customer Intelligence Platform
Status Stack License

DriftSignal is an enterprise-grade SaaS platform designed to centralize, categorize, and automate customer review management for small ecommerce businesses. Built as a capstone project for the MBA course ENTI 633 - Generative AI and Prompting at the University of Calgary, it leverages Generative AI to solve the operational chaos of multi-channel selling.

⚠️ Note on Technical Evolution (Blog Post Discrepancy): As detailed in our project blog post, we initially prototyped this application using Python/Flask (Phase 1). However, during the final sprint, we refactored the codebase to React/Node.js to leverage Replit's "Glass-Morphic" UI capabilities and the superior speed of Grok 4.1. This repository contains the Final Production Build, which differs from the prototype described in the blog's "Prompt Examples."

🚩 The Business Problem: "Death by a Thousand Tabs"
The ecommerce landscape has shifted. Small merchants (generating $50k-$500k/yr) must sell everywhere to survive, but managing feedback across Amazon, Shopify, eBay, and Walmart creates a massive operational tax.

1. The Time Tax
Sellers spend an estimated 5-10 hours per week just logging into disparate portals to check for new reviews. * The Reality: A merchant logs into Amazon Seller Central, then Shopify Admin, then eBay Hub—copying complaints into a spreadsheet manually.

2. The Speed Gap
53% of consumers expect a response to a negative review within one week. * The Risk: A scathing 1-star review on Amazon about "Shipping Delays" can sit unnoticed for days, degrading the seller's algorithm ranking before they even know it exists.

3. The Pricing Failure
Existing solutions (Birdeye, Podium, Trustpilot) target enterprises with pricing models of $300-$500/month. This effectively prices out the 70% of online sellers who generate less than $1M annually.

⚡ The Solution: Unified Intelligence
DriftSignal functions as a "Single Pane of Glass" that consolidates this fragmented workflow into one intelligent dashboard.

Feature 1: The Unified Feed (Headless Aggregation)
Instead of 5 tabs, sellers open 1 dashboard. DriftSignal ingests unstructured text data from live sources (Amazon via Axesso, Walmart via SerpApi) and normalizes it into a standard JSON schema.

Feature 2: AI Triage & Categorization
We utilize Grok 4.1 Fast to act as a Tier-1 Support Agent. It doesn't just read star ratings; it analyzes sentiment velocity to determine the Root Cause: * Shipping: (e.g., "Arrived late", "Box damaged") → Flag for Logistics Team. * Product: (e.g., "Stopped working", "Cheap material") → Flag for Quality Control. * Service: (e.g., "Rude reply", "No refund") → Flag for Owner.

Feature 3: Smart Drafts (RAG)
The system utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation principles to draft professional responses instantly. * Logic: If the review mentions "Shipping Delay," the AI drafts an apology citing carrier delays. * Safety: It is hard-coded not to promise financial refunds without human approval.
