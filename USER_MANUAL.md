# DriftSignal: User Guide & Testing Instructions

## 1. Quick Start (For Graders)
* **Live App URL:** [https://replit.com/@reiddm1/DriftSignal](https://replit.com/@reiddm1/DriftSignal)
* **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/choudhry26usman/DriftSignal](https://github.com/choudhry26usman/DriftSignal)

## 2. Authentication (Demo Mode)
To access the dashboard, use the following pre-configured credentials:
* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `demo123`
*(Note: If no login screen appears, the session may already be active via Replit).*

## 3. How to Test Core Features

### A. View the Unified Feed
1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2.  You will see a live feed of reviews aggregated from **Amazon**, **Shopify**, and **Walmart**.
3.  **Test:** Click the "Source" filter dropdown to toggle between "Amazon Only" or "Walmart Only."

### B. Test the AI Analysis
1.  Find a review with a **Red** border (Negative Sentiment).
2.  Hover over the "AI Insights" badge.
3.  **Observation:** You will see a breakdown of the specific issue (e.g., "Shipping Delay" or "Product Quality") generated by GPT-4.

### C. Generate a Response (The "Magic" Feature)
1.  Click the blue **"Draft Reply"** button on any negative review.
2.  Wait 2-4 seconds for the AI to generate a personalized email.
3.  **Action:** Click **"Send Response"** to trigger the email simulation.
    * *Success Indicator:* A green "Email Sent" toast notification will appear at the top right.

## 4. Troubleshooting
* **Reviews Not Loading?** Refresh the page. The system will default to the `DummyJSON` mock data if the external API rate limit is hit.
* **"API Error" on Reply?** This typically means the OpenAI quota is momentarily exceeded. Wait 10 seconds and try again.
